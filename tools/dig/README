Greetings.

You are the proud owner of 'dig' version 1.0; a command-line tool
for querying Domain Name System servers. With proper care and
treatment, you will be able to enjoy your digger for years to come.

The files in this distribution are:

Makefile@               libresolv.a-vax         res_debug.c
Makefile.resolv         nameser.h               res_init.c
README                  netdb.h                 res_mkquery.c
dig-sun3*               options.c               res_query.c
dig-vax*                param.h                 res_send.c
dig.c                   pflag.h                 resolv.h
dig.txt                 qroot                   sethostent.c
gethostnamadr.c         qtime.c                 strcasecmp.c
herror.c                qtime.h                 subr.c
hfiles.h                res.h                   subr.h
libresolv.a-sun3        res_comp.c


Noteworthy files:
----------------
dig.txt	- ascii man pages
dig.c	- dig source code
qroot	- simple sample batch query file

As is, 'dig' has been compiled without any hacks in several
sun3, vax, and microvax environments. In doing so, several
#include files were found to be non-existent and/or misplaced
on the various systems. These files (arpa/nameser.h, sys/param.h,
netdb.h, resolv.h) have been included with the distribution and are
included in the system through the file "hfiles.h". If 'dig' or the
resolver library does not compile "as-is" (or if you want to include
your more up to date files) you may be able to simply change the
#define's in "hfiles.h".


Dig has already been compiled for a sun3 and a vax architecture.
You should find a resolver library (libresolv.a-XXX) and running
`dig` (dig-XXX) for each.


Dig may be compiled with you own resolver library, but expect
the following changes:
	- RTT and packet count stats not printed
	- different output format (closer to nslookup)
	- print options are meaningless

If you are going to compile using your own resolver you
must set the "-DRESLOCAL" flag (makefile will also
"make dig-local").


Dig will also work in environments that are not currently running
the Domain Name System. This may be useful while bringing up the
system. However, this may require slight adjustments or impose
certain constraints ... from the man pages:

	(NOTE: If the server to query is specified by its domain
	name, this name will be resolved using the domain name system
	resolver. If your system does not support DNS, you may *have*
	specify a dot-notation address. Alternatively, if there is
	a server at your disposal somewhere, all that is required
	is that /etc/resolv.conf be present and indicate where the
	default name servers reside, so that server_name itself can
	be resolved. See man resolver(5) for /etc/resolv.conf
	information. Also, the user may set the environment variable
	LOCALRES to name a file which is to be used instead of 
	/etc/resolv.conf. If this variable is not set or the file
	is not readable then /etc/resolv.conf will be used.)


Comments and suggestions are welcome.
