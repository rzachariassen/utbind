To install BIND 4.8+ on a Sun 3.x (x > 2) system:

rm -f /usr/include/{netdb.h,resolv.h} /usr/include/arpa/nameser.h
cp include/netdb.h.4.2 /usr/include/netdb.h
cp include/resolv.h /usr/include/resolv.h
cp include/arpa/nameser.h /usr/include/arpa/nameser.h
cp bin/mkdep /usr/ucb
cd res
make -f Makefile.resolv depend
make -f Makefile.resolv
make -f Makefile.resolv install
make -f Makefile.resolv clean
cd ../named
make depend
make RES=-lresolv
make install
make clean
cp named.reload named.restart /etc
cd ../tools
make RES=-lresolv
make install
cp nsquery nstest /usr/local
make clean

To install on a 4.3bsd system using libresolv.a, replace the first cp with:

cp include/netdb.h /usr/include/netdb.h

To install the resolver library in libc.a (on a 4.3bsd system), do:

cd /usr/src/lib/libc/net
mkdir 4.3dist
mv -f Makefile res_*.c 4.3dist
cd named
mkdir 4.3dist
mv -f Makefile *.c 4.3dist
ln -s ../../../../usr.lib/bind/res/named/* .
make depend
make
cd ..
ln -s ../../../usr.lib/bind/res/{Makefile,herrno.c,res_*.c} .
make depend
make
cd /usr/src/usr.lib/libc
make
(twiddle thumbs)
cp libc.a /lib/libc.a
ranlib /lib/libc.a
cp libc_p.a /usr/lib/libc_p.a
ranlib /usr/lib/libc_p.a
(the above may be replaced by a 'make install')


If you wish to recompile programs affected by this change (new resolver
routines), here is a partial list to start you off:

/bin:		hostid login mail rcp

/etc:		arp fingerd ftpd gettable htable ifconfig inetd
		named ping rexecd rlogind route routed rshd rwhod
		syslogd talkd telnetd timedc uucpd

/usr/games:	hunt lib/hunt.driver

/usr/lib:	lpd sendmail uucp/uucico

/usr/ucb:	finger ftp lpr netstat quota rlogin rsh rwho systat talk
		telnet tftp tn3270 whois

/usr/local:	?


To start the nameserver, run /etc/named.restart.  Watch syslog for complaints.
Clean up your data and restart named until complaints stop appearing.  One
widespread change is that all instances of ANY in your data files must be
replaced with IN.

You may wish to look through the setup directory if you aren't sure what this
is all about.

Have fun.
